# Module_14_InteractiveViz

In this project, I developed an interactive data visualization based on the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset.

The application leverages the D3.js library to load and visualize data in a dynamic and user-friendly interface. Key features of the website include:

-Bubble Chart
-Dropdown Menu
-Bar Chart

This interactive visualization allows users to explore and engage with the biodiversity data in a meaningful way.
